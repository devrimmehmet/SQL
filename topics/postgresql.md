# 2.1 - PostgreSQL

## History

1970 "Ingres" --> 1980 --> POST - GRES --> Postgres (POSTQUEL) ---> [Postgres (SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)

In the 1970s, there was a database study called Ingres in Berkeley, California. Unfortunately, these studies became inefficient in the 1980s.
And in the 1980s, a study called PostGres was started to solve these problems. In the 1990s, improvements were made and instead of using a query language called POSTQUEL, the use of SQL was started. Thus PostgreSQL was born.
